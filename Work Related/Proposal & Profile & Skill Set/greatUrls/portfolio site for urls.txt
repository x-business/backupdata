Vero automates the leasing process. With over tens of thousands of properties, I was the lead front-end engineer who developed most of the core framework for their redesigned web application. 
I worked closely with the design and back-end team, directed the front-end team, and played a major role in engineering decisions.

I was the lead front-end engineer at Phidata, where I spearheaded their web app for monitoring and managing AI apps. Initially the front-end was in very poor shape and I was hired to take charge. I completed the core MVP, which was also crucial for attaining future funding. I redesigned the web app from scratch to give it the aesthetic edge it needed to succeed, and also rewrote most of the codebase to improve maintainability, performance, and securityâ€“especially as the users and size of the team scales. Prior to joining Phidata there were no more than a few hundred GitHub stars. After my marketing, design, and product suggestions were implemented, it skyrocketed to over 11k stars, trending on GitHub multiple times.
